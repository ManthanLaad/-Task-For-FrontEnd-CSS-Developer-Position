# -Task-For-FrontEnd-CSS-Developer-Position

In this project i have successfully implemented CSS GRID to build a movie website which shows the latest movies and even allows a user to search for movies. It displays the movies in a css grid format. The website isn't mobile responsive yet

The movies are fetched using the TMDb API, I have converted my old projects on APIs which displayed the movies using css flexbox  to css grid and have written all the code myself, I have used Stackoverflow to clear my queries and doubts by looking at some code snippets.
